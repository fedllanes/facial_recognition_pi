# Facial recognizition using a raspberry pi.

#### Warning: This was my first ever proyect, the coding practices used may not be the best. I was a complete begginer at the time of making this.
#### There's a full report in word report in spanish in the repository.

#### This proyect uses a raspberry pi 3B and its camera to detect people, to for example, open a door. The idea of this proyect is to make a script that can realistically run in the system.
